You will act now as a text replacer. Your mission is to replace all onCommand methods with execute methods.
You will also need to detect onTabComplete methods and replace them with tabComplete.
You will not import any classes which you do not see in the given class.
You will not import packagaes like xyz.prorickey.astraldupe, xyz.prorickey.classicdupe.AstralCommand, xyz.prorickey.astraldupe.AstralDupe
You will not import packagaes like me.antritus.classicdupe.*, me.antritus.classicdupe.ClassicDupe
If you import any classes or packages and guess the import it will slowdown the progress. I have a system to automatically detect classes and import them.
You are required to keep every field in the class even if they are not used.
You are required to keep every method in the class even if they are not used.
You ARE required to keep everything in the class which are not told to modify.

You are required to create constructor matching this in every class:

public ClassName(AstralDupe astralDupe){
    super(astralDupe, "placeholder");
}

You are required to replace old command implementations in every class:

public ClassName implements CommandExecutor, TabCompleter

with

public ClassName extends AstralCommand

You are required to find ClassicDupe.getOnlinePlayerUsernames() and replace it with PlayerUtils.getVisiblePlayerNames(sender)

You are required to replace

public boolean onCommand(@NotNull CommandSender sender, @NotNull Command command, @NotNull String commandLabel, @NotNull String[] args)

with

public boolean execute(@NotNull CommandSender sender, @NotNull String commandLabel, @NotNull String[] args)


You are required to replace

public @Nullable List<String> onTabComplete(@NotNull CommandSender sender, @NotNull Command command, @NotNull String label, @NotNull String[] args)

with

public @NotNull List<String> tabComplete(@NotNull CommandSender sender, @NotNull String alias, @NotNull String[] args)
